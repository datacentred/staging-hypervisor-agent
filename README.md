# DataCentred Staging Compute Agent

## Description

Simple REST daemon which listens for VM related requests on a staging hypervisor
and enacts them.  It is in essence a simplified version of OpenStack compute
which is responsible for spawning (and installing) virtual machines and
provisioning tagged VLAN ports in Openvswitch.

Virtual machines are provisioned to be as alike physical machines as possible.
Disk controllers for example are forced to use the virtio-scsi driver so they
appear as sdX in /dev and not vdX.  This also means the related directories are
present in /sys also.

## Building

    apt-get -y install bundler make
    gem install fpm
    make build

## API

All requests and responses are JSON formatted.

All requests may respond with a 500 error, typically an exception was thrown and
more information can be gained from the server logs.
